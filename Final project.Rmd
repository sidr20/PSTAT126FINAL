```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 10}
cor(dataset[, c("carat", "y", "z")])
```

There appears to be a very strong, positive correlation between y, z, and carat. All correlation interactions between the three quantitative variables are above 0.95.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
chisq.test(table(dataset$cut, dataset$clarity))
```
A chi-square test was performed to examine the relationship between "cut" and "clarity", the two categorical variables. The p-value is extremely close to 0, indicating that there is a statistically significant association between "cut" and "clarity".
